# Curved Folds of David Huffman

In addition to his famous involvement in data compression,
David Huffman of UC Santa Cruz was a vanguard of curved folding.

I took CS 101 from Huffman, which i barely passed because there was a sudden hockey-stick of difficulty around the middle of the course, and i had been lulled into blowing it off.  Huffman was a bear in CS 101.  Sort of a jerk, in my opinion, but probably we warranted it.  I also audited a graduate course on image compression with him, and in that setting he was super sweet and enjoyable.  I regret not knowing of his passion for mathematical paper-folding at the time, because I'd picked up a bit of that bug by then myself.  This would have been around 1997 or so.

This folder contains a [copy of the paper](Reconstructing%20David%20Huffmans%20Legacy%20in%20Curved-Crease%20Folding.pdf) "Reconstructing David Huffman’s Legacy in Curved-Crease Folding".  The original is hosted at the site of one of the authors: [https://erikdemaine.org/papers/Huffman_Origami5/paper.pdf](https://erikdemaine.org/papers/Huffman_Origami5/paper.pdf) .

The paper is a wonderful read.  In addition to mathematical history and color for Huffman, it includes patterns from which some of the folds can be recreated.  I've printed several on paper and have enjoyed having them around.

What's new is i've made 3D-Printable models of the patterns, which effectively act as pre-scored paper.

My process:

1. create a monochromic image from a figure in the paper, adapting the dotted lines to more continuous lines.
1. convert the image to a .stl 3D file with custom software i've written but not yet shared online.
1. print the resulting .stl file
	* units are millimeters
	* layer thickness should be 0.08mm
