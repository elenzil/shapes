# link_100

A descendant of [bi_a_180](../bi_a_180/README.md),  
this is the first textile i've made where individual sheets can be linked together and even assembled into a torus.  

I recommend printing this with a slightly elevated bed temperature to improve adhesion with these tiny
delicate parts.  For PLA i bumped it about 7ÂºC.  Each sheet took about nine hours for me.  The large green torus in the photos is four sheets, the two smaller ones are each three.

Modeled in Cheetah3D - the files with ".jas" extension.  These still represent things somewhat parametrically.
