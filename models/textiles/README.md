## Textiles

3D Printed textiles are nothing new,  
but I love exploring what can be designed for at-home FDM printers, versus the fancy sintering or resin varieties.

Everything here prints on an FDM printer, with no assembly or post-processing: it comes off the plate ready to go.  

The ".jas" files are for [Cheetah3D](https://www.cheetah3d.com) and are where the modeling was done.
